11,0,0,89,0,0,mixed,0,"First, some background on the ODL. For the last two years the Ontario Library Association",P
11,0,0,88,0,0,mixed,0,"has acted as a catalyst, bringing together the stakeholders needed to create the Ontario",P

11,0,0,89,0,0,mixed,0,We are moving into a period of convergence. With convergence we no longer have to license,P
11,0,0,94,0,0,mixed,0,commercial products as individual libraries or institutions. We can work together to spend our,P
11,0,0,89,0,0,mixed,0,money wisely. The provincial government has made this possible by working hard to provide,P
11,0,0,93,0,0,mixed,0,"all Ontarians with a stable, high-speed communications infrastructure. While there is still a",P
11,0,0,93,0,0,lower,0,"great deal of work needed to improve this infrastructure, libraries are beginning to plan how",P
11,0,0,90,0,0,mixed,0,best to exploit communications technology. We can reduce barriers to access and create the,P

11,0,0,90,0,0,mixed,0,Libraries have long been a key delivery point for public services. The ODL will allow that,P
